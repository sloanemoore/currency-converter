Currency Converter is a simple currency conversion app created with React and Bootstrap. Users can enter an amount, a currency to convert from, and a currency to convert to, and the app will return the conversion.

This app uses [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/) to retrieve exchange rates.
